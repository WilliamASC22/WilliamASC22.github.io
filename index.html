        <div>
            Hi, I am a Computer Science student at the University at Buffalo with interests spanning software engineering, management, and AI. I enjoy building projects that blend technical depth with real-world impact, whether that’s developing full-stack applications, experimenting with AI, or designing interactive web experiences.
            <br><br>
            Outside of programming, I enjoy staying active through sports such as soccer, kickball, and badminton. I also enjoy reading and exploring new ideas, and I am open and excited about opportunities that allow me to experience new cities, environments, and perspectives.
            <br><br>
            Some of my favorite books include <i>Hatchet</i>, <i>Holes</i>, <i>Nineteen Eighty-Four</i>, <i>James and the Giant Peach</i>, and <i>Rich Dad Poor Dad</i>. I am always eager to learn, build, and take on new challenges, especially those that push me beyond my comfort zone.

            <b>VerityBridge</b><br>
            Co-founded and built VerityBridge, an early-stage startup-style real estate platform enabling direct buyer–seller interaction, with persistent backend data storage for property listings, user profiles, favorites, and metadata using Firebase Authentication and Firestore.
            Developed authenticated user and admin workflows supporting full CRUD operations on listings, role-based access control, video tour management, search and filtering functionality, and a responsive frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

            <b>Production-Style Web Server</b><br>
            Built a web application with real-time collaboration and media streaming, implementing WebSockets (drawing-board broadcast, active user lists, continuation and back-to-back frame parsing) and video processing/streaming (FFmpeg thumbnail generation and HLS adaptive bit-rate delivery).
            Designed and deployed a containerized, production-style architecture using Docker Compose and Nginx HTTPS reverse proxy and a separate authentication service that issues RS256-signed JWTs, with the app server verifying tokens independently, plus bcrypt auth cookies (HttpOnly+Secure), DOS attack prevention, and TOTP-based 2FA.
